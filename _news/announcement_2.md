I attended EMNLP 2024 and presented there 3 publications: [Benchmarking vision language models for cultural understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10920), [Social bias probing: Fairness benchmarking for language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09090), and [The Causal Influence of Grammatical Gender on Distributional Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18567).
